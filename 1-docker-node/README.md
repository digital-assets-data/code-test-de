The Dockerfile in this directory will build and run a [Parity](https://www.parity.io/) client and sync the [Expanse](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/expanse/) cryptocurrency blockchain. Expanse is a fork of Ethereum and only used here so you don't have to run and sync the full Ethereum blockchain, which is hundreds of gigabytes. Expanse is much smaller at around 5-6 GB. They are functionally the same.

You can find the docs for interacting with Parity [here](https://wiki.parity.io/JSONRPC-eth-module).

Alternatively, we have a hosted node that you may use. IP: 0.0.0.0, port is the same as in the Dockerfile.

Bonus: Run a different type of node (not Parity based) to pull data from.
